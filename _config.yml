    <p>Our workshop is focused on visual Instance-Level Recognition (ILR), with a primary objective of identifying, comparing, or synthesizing images related to specific objects, scenes, or events. Unlike the broad categorization found in category-level recognition, where classes are defined semantically (e.g., "a chair"), ILR delves into tasks with the utmost granularity in class definition, such as identifying "the chair of my desk". </p><p>This year, we expand the scope of our workshop by introducing a call for papers, in addition to hosting keynote talks by renowned speakers and invited paper talks from the main conference.</p><p>The 2024 Instance-Level Recognition (ILR) Workshop is a follow-up of five successful editions of our previous workshops &mdash; the first two having focused only on landmark recognition (<a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2018" target="_blank"><span class="navy">CVPRW18</span></a>, <a href="https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2019" target="_blank"><span class="navy">CVPRW19</span></a>), the following ones expanding to the domains of artworks and products (<a href="https://ilr-workshop.github.io/ECCVW2020/" target="_blank"><span class="navy">ECCVW20</span></a>, <a href="https://ilr-workshop.github.io/ICCVW2021/" target="_blank"><span class="navy">ICCVW21</span></a>), and the latest one introducing the universal image embedding problem (<a href="https://ilr-workshop.github.io/ECCVW2022/" target="_blank"><span class="navy">ECCVW22</span></a>).</p>
